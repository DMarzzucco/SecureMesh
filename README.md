# SecureMesh
SecureMesh is a distributed testing system focused on security, authentication, and authorization. It implements microservices with gRPC (UserAPI and AuthAPI) to validate credentials and generate tokens, as well as an OAuth2 API Gateway to centralize routes and manage access. Its primary purpose is to explore best practices in authentication and secure communication between services.
